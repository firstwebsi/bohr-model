    <p>The main motive was to tell what to include in the <b><i>electronic configuration of atom</i></b> bhor bury model</p>

    <h2>What are the main points of bhor bury scheme</h2>
    <p>so first of all there are many of the rules which consisted of main ones by bhor :—<p>

<ul><li><b><p>The maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in a cell is give by formula 2n<sup>2</sup>.</p></b></li>
<b><p><li>The maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in the last shell of any atom is 8</p></b></li>
<b><p><li>Electrons will revolve only in special orbits called discreate orbits im which they will not lose energy</p></b></ul></li>

<b><h1>Who was Bohr</h1></b>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Niels_Bohr.jpg/800px-Niels_Bohr.jpg" width="200">
<ul><p><li>Niels Henrik David Bohr was a Danish physicist who made foundational contributions to understanding atomic structure. </p></li>
<p><li>quantum theory, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922</p></li></ul>

<h2>What is Bohr model of an atom?</h2>
<p>It is the model which bohr presented to fix the drawbacks of the Rutherford model of an atom in the past time because that model by rutherford was not able to tell the <b>stabilization of an atom in  an orbit(electron)</b></p>
<ul><li><b><p>Atoms only revolve in special orbits known as discreate orbits.</p></b></li>
<li><b><p>While electrons are revolving in these orbits they do not radiate energy</p></b></li>
<b><p><li>It was derived that there are many shells as possible denoted by K, L, M, N..and so on also 1,2,3,4,...so on and the centre is a nucleus</li></p></b></ul>

<h1>Electronic Configuration (Bohr)</h1>
<p>if we see the first rule of Bohr and Bury scheme we get the formula 2n<sup>2</sup>
by which we can easily think of maximum number of electrons in an atom in each shell
<ul><li>in the first shell n=1 ,2n<sup>2</sup> 2(1x1) = <b> 2 electrons</b></li>
<li>in the second shell n=2 ,2n<sup>2</sup> 2(2x2) = <b> 8 electrons</b></li>
<li>in the third shell n=3 ,2n<sup>2</sup> 2(3x3) = <b> 18 electrons</b></li>
<li>in the fourth shell n=4 ,2n<sup>2</sup> 2(4x4) = <b> 32 electrons</b></li>
</ul>
